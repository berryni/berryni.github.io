I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Iowa State University, and graduated from Texas A&M in 2013. My research is primarily in Unsupervised learning, specifically clustering. I have also done research in graphical models - using Bayesian Networks to perform continuous biometric authentication and detecting underlying graph structures for bacterial microbiomes.
